SOUND FILE FOR THE BREATHING EXERCISE

The website is now configured to use a single sound file:

1. sounds.mp3 - Background sound for the breathing exercise

Your file is already in the correct location, and the script has been updated to use it!

Recommended settings:
- MP3 format is recommended for best browser compatibility
- If you want to use a different sound file, rename it to "sounds.mp3"
